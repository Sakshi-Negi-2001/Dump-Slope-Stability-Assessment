# Artificial Intelligence based Tool for the Stability Assessment of Overburden Dump Slope 

## Problem Statement
Existing softwares to analyse slope stability are expensive with very high computation cost and high computation time.
Open source softwares that exist have a very limited use case. 
Most of the geotechnical engineers do not have necessary technical skills to use the open source tools.
There is an overall lack of existing dataset to use in machine learning or deep learning models for slope stability analysis in mines.


## Objective
Scraping data from various research articles related to overburden slope stability to extract relevant parameters for generating dataset (To be used in the ML/DL models).
To develop machine learning models for predicting the Factor of Safety (FOS) using generated dataset.
Hyper-tuning and validation of the results received from the machine learning models with processed data from industry-leading numerical simulation software.
To develop a graphical user interface tool.


## Methodology
